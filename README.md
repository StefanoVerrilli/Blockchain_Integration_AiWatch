# About AiWatch and the blockchain integration
***
AIWatch is a research project with is intended to create a real-world video surveillance system that is capable of creating a digital twin for each human detected by the system and detect and report any abnormal behavior on them. Informations reguarding detected entities in the envoariament are trasmitted and recorded into a dedicated digital twin of the physical location.

The proposed integration of blockchain functionalities in order to guarantee the validity of the data transmitted to the digital twin concerns:
- Private Backbone blockchain used to validate the transactions exchanged between modules: ```BesuBlockchain```
- Creation of operational logic contracts: ```Contracts```
- Integration of appropriate sub-modules for the communication with the blockchain: ```DittoModule``` and ```TrackerModule```
